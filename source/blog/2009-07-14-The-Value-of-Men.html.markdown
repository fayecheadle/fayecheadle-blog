I saw this article on BBC News the other day, about the development of sperm from stem cells. It breifly mentions the scientific discovery and then dives into the response of certain bloggers:

[Life without men](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8142104.stm)

Some examples:

"Yet I feel compelled - and not just as the mother of two small boys - to make a spirited defence of the weaker sex. Where would I be without my husband to read 80 pages of a car manual, in French, to find out how the back windscreen-wiper works?" - [Men are redundant, but let's keep them anyway](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/rowanpelling/5771359/Men-are-redundant-but-lets-keep-them-anyway.html)

"Women have always known that men are a bit of a waste of space … Now British scientists have proved how unnecessary blokes truly are by creating the first human sperm from stem cells." - [The end of men?](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/the-end-of-men-scientists-create-sperm-405260)

These are sarcastic comments, but you hear this sort of thing often. That all men are pigs, for instance.  The fact that this kind of misandry is usually tolerated is shocking.

The problem seems to be that not much is expected of men anymore. It's (apparently) prissy to look nice, to clean up, to admire and be kind to your partner.  Men are redundant and unnecessary, and women are telling their husbands that what they're good for is knowing how the car works (!). Perhaps they don't realize they're also sending this message to the young men around us that are trying to find their way through the world.

When you say all men are pigs or slobs, they have no reason to act any better than a lazy bum. When you proliferate the idea that men are useless, why would they strive for greatness? Why would they bother with being a good person?

My husband is a good man who showed me how to have pride in myself. My father and brother are intelligent and productive men, who both taught me the values I still hold today. My father-in-law and brother-in-law are both kind and caring and welcomed me into their family, which I'm grateful for. I'm friends with men that are doting fathers, dedicated husbands, who dress nicely, clean up the dishes, paint works of art, fight for justice, and certainly are no sissies. They all add so much value to the world and it would feel like a lesser place without them in it. If you don't see what I see, maybe the solution is to start looking in the right places instead of slandering the whole sex.
