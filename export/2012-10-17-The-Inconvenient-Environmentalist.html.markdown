This is an interesting video from The Nature Convervancy's chief scientist, Peter Kareiva.

I don't agree with all of it, but it's refreshing to see environmentalism from a man-based standpoint. He also fights against some myths that really bother me, romanticizing nature without man in it and technology against nature, to name a couple.

What he views as a tactical problem, though, I see as a philosophical one. He starts to make the point that it's about value, and I agree. But how do you know what to value? What guidelines to you use to judge your values? How do you deal with the fact that other people may value different things? This is where, personally, the Objectivist definition of value has been helping me think about this.
<blockquote>Value” is that which one acts to gain and keep, “virtue” is the action by which one gains and keeps it. “Value” presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? “Value” presupposes a standard, a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of an alternative. Where there are no alternatives, no values are possible.</blockquote>
You need your mind for this and if you want others to follow, you need their minds as well. You don't persuade people with legislature. You don't organize strong and lasting communities by bashing people or companies.

Community arises from *value* and what people do to gain or keep a value.
