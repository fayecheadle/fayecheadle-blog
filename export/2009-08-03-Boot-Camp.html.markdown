I've been going to a Boot Camp twice a week for a few weeks, and I finally feel like I'm progressing.  I haven't lost any weight yet, but I feel like I'm getting stronger.  Today was the first day I was able to run up the hills we work out on without totally dying.  It was definitely hard, but I felt like I could handle it, whereas before, I had to stop and catch my breath.  I can also do more pushups.  Hooray!  The beginnings of arm strength!

When I've exercised like this in the past, it's always taken a while for me to see results, so I'm hoping that now my weight will start going down :)  Especially since I've been waking up at 5:30am twice a week for the past month or so!
