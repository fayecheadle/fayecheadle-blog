Ann Druyan cowrote the <em>Cosmos</em> television series with Carl Sagan, and was his wife for the last 15 years of his life.  I don't recall how I came across this speech, but it's great.  It's a talk she gave to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.  She describes the prevalent schism between material reality and the spiritual just beautifully.  <a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ann_druyan_talks_about_science_religion/">Have a look!</a>

<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0.6em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0.6em; padding: 0px;">What happened four or five hundred years ago? During this period there was a great bifurcation. We made a kind of settlement with ourselves. We said, okay, so much of what we believed and what our parents and our ancestors taught us has been rendered untenable. The Bible says that the Earth is flat. The Bible says that we were created separately from the rest of life. If you look at it honestly, you have to give up these basic ideas, you have to admit that the Bible is not infallible, it’s not the gospel truth of the creator of the universe. So what did we do? We made a corrupt treaty that resulted in a troubled peace: We built a wall inside ourselves.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0.6em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0.6em; padding: 0px;">It made us sick. In our souls we cherished a myth that was rootless in nature. What we actually knew of nature we compartmentalized into a place that could not touch our souls. The churches agreed to stop torturing and murdering scientists. The scientists pretended that knowledge of the universe has no spiritual implications.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0.6em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0.6em; padding: 0px;">It’s a catastrophic tragedy that science ceded the spiritual uplift of its central revelations: the vastness of the universe, the immensity of time, the relatedness of all life and it’s preciousness on this tiny world.</p>
