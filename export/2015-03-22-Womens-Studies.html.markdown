When I was in college, I had a very dim view of the feminism. I was lucky to have grown up surrounded by strong women and men. My mom, dad, and older brother were always encouraging my sister and I in math and science. They knew that young women were not always told they could cut it in these classes and made sure that we had positive reinforcement at home. Both of us were pressed to take the most advanced math and science classes that we could. My brother really encouraged me to learn about computers and programming. We were told through words and through actions that our intelligence was valued. We were told that we were beautiful, inside and out.

I had never felt oppressed because of my gender, so I didn't think feminism was important to me. It seemed like it was important in the past because it allowed women to take on roles other than housewife and mother, but now it wasn't necessary anymore. The battle seemed fought and won. I felt ambivalent about it. I carried this with me as I started going to college as a Computer Science major.

College was really difficult for me. Computer Science is a difficult major in and of itself, but I also struggled with tremendous self doubt. I may have been encouraged in more intellectual endeavors, but I was petrified of being seen as stupid. This is something I've struggled with for a long time and things got really bad for me once I was in college. The difficult academic workload and the general turmoil that a young person of that age goes through were enough to completely buckle my self confidence.

During my sophomore year, my roommate was a Women's Studies major. We got along pretty well at the beginning of the year, but by the end of the year, there was a lot of enmity between us. We had drastically diverged as far as our political beliefs and my ambivalence towards feminism had turned into bitterness. I couldn't see what the point was. I saw she and her classmates talking about encouraging women in engineering, but I also saw that none of them wanted to join me there. And it wasn't until years later that I realized how much this hurt me and how much that feeling of isolation had affected me.

One thing that I remember thinking during this time was, "Here I am, toughing it out through all these difficult courses, and she's talking about empowering women as a glorified English major!"

What is feminism?

The most important part of feminism, in my mind, is having empathy for other people. It's about treating others with respect and trying to understand that they might have things to deal with that you don't. You should do this with all people, but feminism focuses on the struggles that women have. I think it's necessary to have a word specifically for female struggle because it helps us organize our thoughts. That's what words and concepts are for. Concepts allow us to focus on certain perceptions so that we can discuss them with others or try to better understand them ourselves.

This is what happened to me in college. I didn't have empathy for my roommate and she didn't have empathy for me.

What is oppression?
Oppression is prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or control. What has happened with the word "feminism" is that we created it to start talking about how women are oppressed. The conversation went from votes for women to marriage to women in the workplace to having control over our bodies. We talked about rape and equal opportunities and gender roles. And the word feminism has been associated to all of these discussions. Anytime you hear someone call themselves a feminist, you add a new perception to what the concept means to you. It could be someone that sounds reasonable to you, so therefore, feminism sounds reasonable. Or it could be someone horrible, so now you think that feminism is horrible. Or it could be a mix of both. This is why we have people proclaiming they're feminists and some people proclaiming that they don't need this word.
