Hooray for Netflix Instant and the Roku!  They enable Tim and I watch lots of movies.  A recent one that I liked was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Priceless</span> with Audrey Tatou and Gad Elmaleh (or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hors de Prix</span> if you're French).  My only complaint would be that it's about a gold digger and a gigolo, which is not the most respectable employment, but they are a charming and endearing pair.  Just look at them:

Ok, so....Audrey Tatou just looks kind of drunk.  Actually, she <em>is</em> drunk.  But never you mind; trust me, she gets charming.  The gist of the movie is that Jean, played by Gad Elmaleh (he's Moroccan, the Wikipedia told me so), is a concierge at a fancy hotel in the Riviera.  He's manning the bar one night by sleeping on the couch (more with the trust, I don't want to spoil things too much), when Miss Terribly Sexy Irene, played by Audrey Tatou, walks in and mistakes him for another patron of said fancy hotel.  He plays along for a while and ends up sleeping with Miss Terribly Drunk Terribly Sexy Irene.  Much to her embarassment in the morning, he is not the wealthy man she thought he was, but a lowly dog walker and waiter.  This puts her in a spot of trouble as she is the mistress of a man that's actually loaded.  He doesn't appreciate the gold digger messing around on him, so he kicks her to the curb.  So now Irene is really miffed with Jean and wants nothing to do with her and poor Jean is smitten.  The only way for him to impress her now is to become a gigolo.

It's a sweet and funny romance set on the Cote D'Azur, so it also has gorgeous scenery.

What I liked
<ul>
	<li>Beautiful actors - Gad Elmaleh surprised me.  He doesn't really pop out as you as a handsome man when you first see him.  He certainly wasn't bad looking, I just didn't think, "Oh, <em>that's</em> a handsome man".  The kind of reaction you have when you look at someone like, say, Jon Hamm.  The man: &lt;pic&gt; The reaction: dang.  It wasn't until</li>
	<li>Beautiful scenery</li>
	<li>funny!  but benevolent</li>
	<li>romantic</li>
