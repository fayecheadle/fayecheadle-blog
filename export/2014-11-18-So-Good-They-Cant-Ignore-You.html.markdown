How to be happy in your career is one of the biggest questions that people ask themselves. You usually hear the advice of "follow your dreams" and "do what you love". I used to agree with this. Recently, however, I have not only questioned it but grown to dislike it quite a bit. The biggest influence in my thinking here would be the show Dirty Jobs. 

At first glance you might think this show is made for shock value and to gross people out with how dirty the jobs can be. Some examples of the jobs seen on this show are worm dung farmer and avian vomitologist. Sounds lovely, right? 

I loved this book. It encapsulated a lot of things I had already been thinking about, like the misguided advice to "follow your passion", and also gave some new perspectives on how to be happy in your work. 


The advice to “follow your passion” is not only incomplete, but dangerous.
Cultivating a skill will make you more happy than chasing a dream. It can also end up being your dream when you didn’t realize it.
